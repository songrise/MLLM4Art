# 🎨 Multimodal LLMs Can Reason about Aesthetics in Zero-Shot | [Paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3746027.3754961) |[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012) 
TL;DR :book:: How can AI models be truly aligned with the multi-faceted human aesthetic judgment? This paper points out that zero-shot reasoning with MLLMs as a promising solution. Extensive experiment reveals that zero-shot aesthetic reasoning outperform the SOTA image aesthetic assessment models, even without any training.

## ArtCoT

We propose ArtCoT to enhance the inference-time reasoning capability of MLLMs. A example conversation is provided below. Detailed quantitative comparison can be found in [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09012). The full response from MLLMs in our experiments will also be released to facilitate further research.
